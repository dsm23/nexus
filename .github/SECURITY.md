# Reporting Security Issues

The following code is currently a template that is used to test out Renovate bot on patterns that I would like to use the future. I will take security bugs in future products seriously thus would like to catch any possible future bugs now. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/dsm23/nexus/security/advisories/new) tab.

How to send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report is currently a **TODO**.
